The Sakila_New_LinkedIn_201908.Zip file contains the dump of data that is used in the LinkedIn Learning course "Getting Started with MySQL 8".
It is used in all the demos and exercises.

How to restore the database:
----------------------------
1. Download Sakila_New_LinkedIn_201908.Zip to your computer and extract its contents.
The Zip file contains the following files:
-> 1_dump-sakila_new.sql
-> 2_dump-sakila_new-inventory.sql
-> 3_dump-sakila_new-rentals.sql
